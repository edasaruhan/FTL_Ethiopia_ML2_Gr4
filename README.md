## 📚 Project Idea:

 Problem Statement: Poor air quality is a major environmental and health concern, especially in
urban areas. Predicting air quality can help policymakers and citizens take preventive measures.
 Objective: Develop a predictive model that forecasts air pollution levels (e.g., PM2.5, PM10,
CO, NO2) using historical air quality data and meteorological conditions


## 🚀 Description of Data

 Dataset Source: U.S. EPA Air Quality Data platform
 Data Format: CSV files with daily/hourly air pollution readings.
 Preprocessing Steps:
   o Handling missing values and outliers.
   o Normalizing and scaling pollution levels.
   o Feature engineering (adding weather conditions, time-based trends)


## 🚀 Relevance to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

 SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being): Reducing air pollution can decrease respiratory diseases
and improve public health.
 SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities): Predicting air quality helps create cleaner and
healthier urban environments.
 SDG 13 (Climate Action): Monitoring pollution contributes to mitigating environmental impacts
and climate change.
